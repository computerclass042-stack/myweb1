    <p>UNIT <br>
        INTRODUCTION DATA, EXPRESSIONS, STATEMENTS <br>
        Introduction to Python and installation, data types: Int, float, Boolean, string, and list; <br>
        variables, expressions, statements, precedence of operators, comments; modules, functions--- function and its
        use, flow of execution, parameters and arguments.
        Introduction to Python and installation: <br>
        Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was initially <br>
        designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It <br>
        was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers <br>
        to express concepts in fewer lines of code. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more
        efficiently. <br>
        There are two major Python versions- Python 2 and Python 3. <br>

        • On 16 October 2000, Python 2.0 was released with many new features. <br>
        • On 3rd December 2008, Python 3.0 was released with more testing and includes new
        features. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Beginning with Python programming: <br>
        (1) Finding an Interpreter: <br>
        Before we start Python programming, we need to have an interpreter to interpret and run our
        programs. There are certain online interpreters like https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/, <br>
        http://ideone.com/ or http://codepad.org/ that can be used to start Python without installing
        an interpreter. <br>
        Windows: There are many interpreters available freely to run Python scripts like IDLE
        (Integrated Development Environment) which is installed when you install the python
        software from http://python.org/downloads/ <br>
        (2) Writing first program:

Why to use Python: <br>
The following are the primary factors to use python in day-to-day life: <br>
1. Python is object-oriented 
Structure supports such concepts as polymorphism, operation overloading and 
multiple inheritance. <br>
2. Indentation 
Indentation is one of the greatest feature in python

 <br>
3. It’s free (open source) 
Downloading python and installing python is free and easy <br/>
4. It’s Powerful <br/>
 Dynamic typing <br/>
 Built-in types and tools <br/>
 Library utilities <br/>
 Third party utilities (e.g. Numeric, NumPy, sciPy) <br/>
 Automatic memory management <br/>
5. It’s Portable <br/>
 Python runs virtually every major platform used today <br/>
 As long as you have a compaitable python interpreter installed, python <br/>
programs will run in exactly the same manner, irrespective of platform. <br/>
6. It’s easy to use and learn <br/>
 No intermediate compile <br/>
 Python Programs are compiled automatically to an intermediate form called <br/>
byte code, which the interpreter then reads. 
 This gives python the development speed of an interpreter without the <br/>
performance loss inherent in purely interpreted languages. <br/>
 Structure and syntax are pretty intuitive and easy to grasp. <br/>
7. Interpreted Language 
Python is processed at runtime by python Interpreter <br/>
8. Interactive Programming Language 
Users can interact with the python interpreter directly for writing the programs <br/>
9. Straight forward syntax 
The formation of python syntax is simple and straight forward which also makes it 
popular. <br/>
Installation: <br/>
There are many interpreters available freely to run Python scripts like IDLE (Integrated 
Development Environment) which is installed when you install the python software 
from http://python.org/downloads/ <br/>
Steps to be followed and remembered: <br/>
Step 1: Select Version of Python to Install. <br/>
Step 2: Download Python Executable Installer. <br/>
Step 3: Run Executable Installer. <br/>
Step 4: Verify Python Was Installed On Windows. <br/>

Step 5: Verify Pip Was Installed. <br>
Step 6: Add Python Path to Environment Variables (Optional) <br>

Working with Python  <br>

Python Code Execution: <br>

Python’s traditional runtime execution model: Source code you type is translated to byte 
code, which is then run by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). Your code is automatically 
compiled, but then it is interpreted.<br>

There are two modes for using the Python interpreter: <br>
• Interactive Mode <br>
• Script Mode <br>
      <br>
     m.py <br>
     
   m.pyc <br>
 
  
    PVM <br>

Running Python in interactive mode: <br>
Without passing python script file to the interpreter, directly execute code to Python prompt. <br>
Once you’re inside the python interpreter, then you can start. <br>
>>> print("hello world") <br>
hello world <br>
# Relevant output is displayed on subsequent lines without the >>> symbol <br>
>>> x=[0,1,2] 
# Quantities stored in memory are not displayed by default. <br>
>>> x <br>
#If a quantity is stored in memory, typing its name will display it. <br>
[0, 1, 2] <br>
>>> 2+3 <br>
